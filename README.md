# Logic
1. Enter commands to update the states of the batteries.
2. Each update also prints the status to the terminal and saves it to a csv file in case of program crash.
3. The program continues to run until the user types "exit".

# Battery
1. Each battery has an id, color, voltage level, and the team it is assigned to.
2. We don't need to care about which box the battery is in, the important information is which team has the battery.
3. All the fields should be updated with commands.
4. When assigned to a team, the user should be pinged periodically to check on the voltage level to make sure it does not get too low.
